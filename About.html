<i>Letter to the Sojourner </i>


I started this webpage in early March of 2019. In infancy of this webpage I made many edits to make the site more aesthetically pleasing. 
With time I plan to have journal entries and even entire books on electrics containing some thoughts that I have had throughout the years. In 
disastification with the teaching methods that I had recieved in my own schooling growing up. I see to it that any aspiring autodidact can attain 
some level of mastery using the resources I have laid out on this site.
